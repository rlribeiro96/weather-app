# WeatherApp ⛈

WeatherApp is a simple application that shows the current weather based on the provided location. 

All the API calls are made by using the Retrofit library. 
The applications consults endpoints provided by https://www.metaweather.com/

The app also utilizes Picasso, a well-known Android third party library to easily display images into ImageViews providing its URL.



To run the project you have to open it using Android Studio and either build in a virtual device or a physical Android device. 

WeatherApp still needs some improvements: 
- First access shows the current location weather (almost got it done, discarded at the last moment)
- More solid MVVM architecture implementation
- Error handling more efficiently 
- Cleaner code 
- Dependency injection
- More testing

Unfortunately due to a tight schedule and busy days, all of this could not be implemented.
