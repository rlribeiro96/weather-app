# weather-app â›ˆ

WeatherApp is a simple Android application that shows the current weather based on the provided location. 

All the API calls are made by using the Retrofit library. 
The applications consults endpoints provided by https://www.metaweather.com/

The app also utilizes Picasso, a well-known Android third party library to easily display images into ImageViews providing its URL.



To run the project you have to open it using Android Studio and either build in a virtual device or a physical Android device. 

WeatherApp still needs some improvements: 
- First access shows the current location weather (almost got it done, discarded at the last moment)
- More solid MVVM architecture implementation
- Error handling more efficiently 
- Cleaner code 
- Dependency injection
- More testing

Unfortunately due to a tight schedule and busy days, all of this could not be implemented.
